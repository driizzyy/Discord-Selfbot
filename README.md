## Command Execution via Remote User

This SelfBot supports executing commands remotely if you are listed in the `remote-users` array in `config/config.json`. You can manage the list of remote users using the `remoteuser` command.

### Example
1. Add your Discord user ID to `remote-users` in the configuration file, or use the `*remoteuser ADD @user(s)` command to add users to the list.
2. From another account, type `*help` (assuming `*` is the prefix). If you are in the list, you can execute commands.
3. You can also remove users from the list with `*remoteuser REMOVE @user(s)`.

This allows for greater flexibility in managing who can control the bot remotely.

## Autoreply Command

The `autoreply` command lets you set up automatic responses in specific channels or for specific users.

### Usage
- **Enable autoreply in a channel**: `autoreply ON`
  - Automatically sends preconfigured messages when someone messages in the channel.
- **Disable autoreply in a channel**: `autoreply OFF`
  - Stops automatic replies in the channel.
- **Enable autoreply for a user**: `autoreply ON @user`
  - Sends automatic replies to all messages from the specified user, regardless of the channel or DM.
- **Disable autoreply for a user**: `autoreply OFF @user`

### Configuration
Messages, channels, and users for autoreply are stored in `config/config.json`:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    "https://github.com/driizzyy",
    "https://discord.gg/N99dWHJTXB"
  ],
  "channels": ["123456789012345678"],
  "users": ["112233445566778899"]
}
```
